In this example, we convert the food item into a class (See FoodItem.php). The
class itself is rather unremarkable except for the edit($foodItem) function
that takes another food item as an argument to update (Edit) the values of the
current food item.

This example has also updated database.php with the new manner of storing data.
Moreover, changes were also made to index.php and list.php to use FoodItem
instead of arrays, although to a lesser extent.

As an exercise, see if you can take the code from the unchanged directory (the
same code using arrays as before the modifications) and make the same changes
as were completed here.
